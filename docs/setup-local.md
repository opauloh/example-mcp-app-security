# Running the Server Locally

Build from source and run the MCP server on your machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **Elasticsearch 8.x or 9.x** with Security enabled
- **Kibana 8.x or 9.x** (for cases, rules, and attack discovery)
- **`ELASTICSEARCH_URL` and `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`**
- **`KIBANA_URL`**

You need both service URLs plus a single Elasticsearch API key for full functionality.

## Creating an API key

You need an Elasticsearch API key with sufficient privileges for the operations you want to perform (reading alerts, managing cases, writing detection rules, etc.).

- **Kibana UI:** Go to **Stack Management > API Keys > Create API key**
- **Elastic docs:** [Elasticsearch API keys](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/api-keys/elasticsearch-api-keys)

For a quick start, a key with the `superuser` role works for all tools. For production, scope the key to the minimum required privileges.

Kibana API keys and Elasticsearch API keys are the same underlying credential type. This project uses `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY` for both Elasticsearch and Kibana requests, so you only need to configure one API key value.

## Steps

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/elastic/example-mcp-app-security.git
cd example-mcp-app-security
npm install

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Elasticsearch URL, Kibana URL, and Elasticsearch API key

# Build
npm run build

# Run
npm start
# Server is now running at http://localhost:3001/mcp
```

## Next Steps

With the server running, connect it to your MCP host:

- [Add to Cursor](./setup-cursor.md)
- [Add to Claude Desktop](./setup-claude-desktop.md)
- [Add to Claude.ai](./setup-claude-ai.md)
