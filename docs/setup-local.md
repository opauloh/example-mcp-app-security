# Running the Server Locally

Build from source and run the MCP server on your machine.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **Elasticsearch 8.x or 9.x** with Security enabled
- **Kibana 8.x or 9.x** (for cases, rules, and attack discovery)
- **`ELASTICSEARCH_URL` and `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY`**
- **`KIBANA_URL` and `KIBANA_API_KEY`**

Both Elasticsearch and Kibana credentials are required for full functionality.

## Steps

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/elastic/example-mcp-app-security.git
cd example-mcp-app-security
npm install

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your required Elasticsearch/Kibana URLs and API keys

# Build
npm run build

# Run
npm start
# Server is now running at http://localhost:3001/mcp
```
